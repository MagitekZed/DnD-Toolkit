# DnD-Toolkit

Small client-side toolkit for running Dungeons & Dragons 5e games.
It combines a damage‑per‑round calculator with an initiative tracker
and various dice utilities.

## Features

- **DPR Calculator** – build attacks or spells and estimate expected damage.
- **Round Composer** – combine multiple attacks/spells and apply once-per-round options.
- **Weapon Masteries** – toggle Cleave, Graze, and Vex effects in attack simulations.
- **Initiative Tracker** – manage combat order with conditions and auto‑sorting.
- **Dice Utilities** – roll expressions, compute averages and simulate advantage modes.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to use the app. All logic runs locally in
`app.js` with styling from `styles.css`.

## Development

The project uses only static files; no build step is required. Feel free to
fork and modify for your own campaigns.
